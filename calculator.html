                        <strong>This is a tool for calculating character builds in Wayfinder.</strong>
                        <p>
                            A build consists of a Wayfinder (character), a weapon, several accessories, and a variety of echoes. These things
                            contribute to the 9 main stats, displayed to you in the 'Total' section. If you want a clear picture of how the stats
                            actually work, see “How do stats actually work in this game?”. If you see any values you can't modify, they are either
                            values that are derived from the rest of the stats, or they're default universal values the game uses. See the instructions
                            for the advanced stuff below for more details.
                        </p>
                        <strong>To get your build started follow these steps:</strong>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Select your Wayfinder and the desired level</li>
                            <li>Base stats should populate, and you should see your internal stats at whatever level you selected.</li>
                            <li>Input the desired character affinities in percentage. Character affinities only affect weapon and accessory stats.
                            </li>
                            <li>Do the same for weapons. This time though, weapon affinities will affect the internal stats of the weapon.</li>
                            <li>For each accessory you're building for, input the stat and category that accessory will affect, up to 3 for each
                                accessory, up to 3 accessories.</li>
                            <li>In the future, we'll have a way to select from existing accessories at the desired level</li>
                            <li>Power level for accessories is optional, the numbers you enter will be added to the total power level of the build
                                at the end.</li>
                            <li>For echoes, you have to manually enter them in. Select the stat the echo will affect, enter in the value, the power
                                level, and click 'Add Echo'</li>
                            <li>If you wish to remove an echo from the list, select it in the list and click 'Remove Echo'</li>
                            <li>In 'Total' you'll see your total combined internal stats and finally your Display Stats, which should be what you
                                see in-game when you open the Character menu.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <strong>Advanced:</strong>
                        <p>
                            Use the controls in the 'Advanced' section to be able to manually input multipliers, base stats, and other values that
                            the game sets be default.
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Power Level growth is the rate at which a Wayfinder power budget grows linearly. 18 by default.</li>
                            <li>Budget modifiers are applied to get internal stats. The same budget modifier is used for every character, this is
                                essentially the weight stat.</li>
                            <li>Char modifiers are applied to get internal stats as well, but by default the game sets this to one for every stat. I 
                                have no clue why this is, but you can use it for whatever, it will multiply your internal stats. Despite the name
                                char modifiers will still affect weapons.</li>
                            <li>Display modifiers are what the game multiplies your internal stats by to display to the player.</li>
                            <li>The base power level is determined by the total of your stats. Every charcter happens to have their stats add up 
                                to 120.</li>
                            <li>Use Reset To Default to reset all values to their defaults.</li>

                            The game gives a very round-about way of telling you what your stats are, and will change stat
                            values of items in menus depending on what your build is to make the process 'easier' for
                            players who are just picking out items from menus. Additionally, your stats aren't actually your
                            true stats, but actually a combination of your power level and several internal (hidden)
                            multipliers. This unfortunately makes builds really difficult to plan ahead if you're already
                            advanced in the game looking at false stats on different items, and hopefully this tool aims to
                            make things a tad bit easier.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Stats start off as what we call <strong>base stats</strong> which never change, and a power
                            level that grows with your character. A calculation is made with your base stats to determine
                            how the game distributes your <strong>stat budget</strong> to your character along with a
                            universal budget multiplier different for each stat in order to create <strong>internal
                                stats</strong>. These internal stats are probably used for game calculations like damage and
                            healing, but we don't really know that for sure. Unfortunately, the player doesn't actually see
                            these stats, because the game uses a final display multiplier to get your <strong>display
                                stats</strong> and these are the stats you actually see in-game when you open the Character
                            menu. Confusing? Don't worry, it gets worse. </p>
                        <p>
                            Your weapon, accessories, and echoes all contribute stats towards your character, in addition to
                            your character's display stats, the combination of which is what is <strong>actually</strong>
                            displayed when you open the Character menu. And just like characters, all items that give stats
                            in the game go through the same process as a character to determine its stats, with minor
                            variations. </p>
                        <p>
                            Weapons are pretty much exactly like characters, except for tempering. While leveling up a
                            weapon or a character increases its power level increases, and therefore its stat budget grows
                            bigger. Unlike characters weapons can be tempered every 5 levels, each tempering increasing the
                            power level ever so slightly. Weapon stats are affected by your affinities (see affinities). The
                            weapon's power level is combined with your own when determining power level to display to the
                            player, however that power level combination doesn't affect your character's actual stats.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Accessories are found at a static power level, that is determined by the conditions you were in
                            when you found it. If you're in a low power level dungeon you might find a low power level
                            accessory. If you run that same dungeon at a higher tier of difficulty, you might find the same
                            accessory but at a higher power level. Additionally, accessories are affected by your
                            character's affinities but not your weapon affinities (again, see affinities). The power level
                            increase for weapons also works the same way for accessories.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Echoes are small stat boosts (or special effects in the case of E-type echoes) that you can
                            equip to characters, weapons, and accessories in the echoes tab. Slotting in an echoes costs
                            points, which are halved if the slot letter matches the type of the echo you want to slot in.
                            echoes are not affected by affinities. [Research needs to be done if echoes are affected by
                            affinities when attached to the same stat boost as an affinity increased category.]
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>TL;DR:</strong> Stats start as base stats, become internal stats, and are displayed as

                            Affinities are a percentage increase to weapons and accessories. There are three categories for
                            affinities, <em class="instinct">instinct</em>, <em class="discipline">discipline</em>, and <em
                                class="focus">focus</em>. Your weapon and accessories all have stats that belong to one of
                            the three categories, and it's different for every item in the game. Weapons usually have 6
                            stats, 2 for each category. The Affinities tab is separated into Character Affinities at the top
                            and Weapon Affinities at the bottom.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Character affinities allow you to spend resources in a category to get affinity in that
                            category. To put it simply, if you have 15% affinity in <em class="instinct">instinct</em>, all of
                            your <em class="instinct">instinct</em> stats on your weapons and accessories get 15% better.
                            Additionally, 5% in a single category gives an affinity perk, unique to each character.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Weapon affinities are the same as character affinities, except they only apply to your weapon,
                            not to your accessory.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you have any character affinities on the character you currently have equipped, the game will
                            automatically update the stats of weapons and accessories in menus to match what the stats they
                            would have on that equipped character. For example, let's say character 1 with 0 affinities in
                            <em class="focus">focus</em> looks at a weapon with 100 Weapon Power in the <em
                                class="focus">focus</em> category. Character 1 sees the stat for what it really is. If
                            character 2 with 15% affinity in <em class="focus">focus</em> looks at the same weapon,
                            they'll see the Weapon Power stat as 115 instead of 100.

                            There's one more factor that changes stats I have yet to mention; instance power ratings aren't
                            just a recommendation. If your power rating is beyond the current area's power rating, your power
                            rating is <strong>scaled down</strong> to match the area's power rating + some number, and because
                            your power rating influences your character's stat budget, your stats are decreased to
                            compensate. Your power rating will <strong>never scale up</strong> beyond the baseline power
                            rating your build puts you at. If you're attempting to record statistics or measure your build,
                            do so in an area that's either above your power rating or in the main hub, otherwise you'll get
                            different numbers every time.

                            Critical hits in this game are not very simple (who would've guessed based on how they treat the
                            stats). This will be explored further in preparation for a future damage calculator, but if you
                            want to use this builder to build a character design for crit, here's what you need to know.
                            Critical hits are determined by the Crit Rating, which represents how likely you are to deal a
                            critical hit. The percent chance you have to critically hit is a combination of how low level
                            the enemy is compared to you and how high your Crit Rating is. Essentially, higher Crit Rating
                            allows you to critically hit more often against higher level enemies.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The exact calculation for critical hits is unknown, but for the purposes of a build generally
                            you can expect to critically hit somewhat often around enemies the same level as you, as long as
                            you keep focusing on your Crit Rating. At a certain limit, Crit Rating will likely cap out, in
                            which case it would be better to focus on boosting Crit Power. Once the formula for critical
                            hits is determined, we can make more assumptions and theorize about the best way to min-max
                            critical hits.

                            Power Level is this games version of measuring the power of a particular build. The game adds up all the
                            individual power levels from different parts of your build to get your total power level. However behind
                            the scenes, a much more complicated process is going on, due to the way the game chooses to display stats
                            to you... again. The following is somewhat speculative and somewhat based on my experience looking at,
                            playing, and analyzing this game. A big problem when it comes to power levels is that we're not really
                            sure how they work for accessories and echoes without further datamining, because we can't record level up
                            growth for those pieces.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Every item in the game (Wayfinders are items in your inventory as well) that can be equipped has a base
                            power level and a power level growth value. These values never change. When you level up your Wayfinder
                            or weapon, the game calculates on the fly your item's stats based on your base power level and your leveled 
                            growth. However, the game still has to give your items a power rating above the base power level to show
                            that growth to the player, so it also calculates that value. Not only does this make terminology a little bit
                            confusing, but this gets interesting when we throw external modifiers into our items, the most common being
                            affinities.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When you level up an affinity, the power rating of the weapons and accessories affected by that affinity also goes
                            up, because those weapons are 'stronger'. Despite the fact that the power rating that's shown to the player increases,
                            the actual base power level of the item that's used to determine its stats likely remains the same. Is this too 
                            complicated? Let's throw some more unknown variables into the mix:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you read the section above on why your stats might be changing when you enter an instance, you'd know that
                            instances with power ratings well below your build's power rating will scale back your power rating, which in turn
                            scales down your stats to match. How this must work internally is the game likely takes the difference between your
                            power rating and the target power rating as a percentage, and scales back all of your stats using that percentage as
                            a straight multiplier. The only other option would be that the game somehow temporarily decreases your base power level 
                            based on the difference, which would likely put you into the negative base power level range depending on how harsh the
                            scaling is. The latter option makes me physically revolt thinking about it so I'm going to assume it's not the case, but
                            yeah we don't actually know quite yet.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>TL;DR:</strong> don't be suprised if your power rating in games doesn't match the one from this build tool, 
                            power levels are weird.

                    <ul>
                        <li>The game rounds numbers when they're displayed to the player. If you're off by
                            1 or 2 in a stat, that's probably the reason.</li>
                        <li>Double check your math; I know it's probably not what you want to hear, but it's really easy
                            in this game to miss something if you don't follow all the steps and double check your work
                            because of the way stats are displayed. Make sure you've counted all your Echoes and
                            affinities.</li>
                        <li>Any active buffs that affect your stats will also affect them in the Character menu, so be
                            sure you're clear of all effects.</li>
                        <li>Make sure your power level isn't being scaled down due to the instance you're in. See 'Why do my stats change 
                            when I enter an instance?'</li>
                        <li>Try asking any questions you might have in the official Wayfinder Discord or Reddit. It may
                            be that you're unsure of how specific stats work, and the people in the community are more
                            than happy to help.</li>
                        <li>If you run into a discrepency between the build calculator and the game, and you have some idea as to why,
